# srv6pm-delay-measurement

This project provides a solution for end-to-end delay monitoring of SRv6 based services.
The proposed solution leverages the Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
and its extensions to monitor the delay of an SRv6 path between two measurement nodes,
called STAMP Session-Sender and Session-Reflector.

The measurement architecture also includes an SDN controller, as shown in the following figure.

The instructions to run the delay monitoring are reported in the following document:
